Week 8 was a pretty packed one - apologies for the late post. I took a week off work and went to Hong Kong for a few days, then flew to Tokyo and joined a friend for the first few days of his epic ride from Tokyo to the southern tip of Japan.

Two Types of Exploring
======
On my flight from Hong Kong to Tokyo, I forgot to grab my headphones out of my bag, so I resorted to seeing what the inflight magazine had to offer. Ending up on a page dedicated to the white sand beaches of Da Nang, Vietnam, my mind drifted to my plans to stay in one place versus travel around continuously. 

Before I set off for Chiang Mai, I had it in my head that I wanted to find one place, get to know the culture and local people there, and really explore the place fully over a few years. 

Reading about the beach, I'm starting to consider whether it would be nice to switch up vibes every few months, and keep experiencing the exciting "newness" of different places. It would be easy to keep traveling - go to Vietnam, Singapore, Bali, Kuala Lumpur - just on tourist visas. I'd meet new people, try new foods, experience different vibes and expose myself to different cultures. 

I think what's missing about this vision is a certain depth, that's hard to know you're even missing when it's gone. A depth of understanding about a culture and a place that only comes from prolonged exposure and going beyond the "digital nomad" communities, hotspots, co-working spaces. What I hope staying in one place will force me to do is branch out beyond these comfortable, semi-western enclaves in to challenging situations, where I have to start learning a new language and understanding a new culture beyond a surface level. Hopefully the act of branching out in one place will provide all the excitement one can get on the road. 

In the Onsen
======
After a day eating kakigori (Japanese shaved ice) and getting many massage offers in Tokyo, we set off on our scooters straight west of Tokyo in to the mountains. After a short stop for some incredible tonkatsu in Fuchu, near the edge of the Tokyo sprawl, we hit the crisp mountain air and rode up to some beautiful vistas of turning leaves. We had now entered one of the many parts of Japan with _onsen_, natural mineral hot springs fueled by volcanic heat. We chose an onsen in the hills and found it totally empty. 

Sitting in the bubbling water amid volcanic rock, uneasiness and preoccupation bothered me. Why was this feeling here, especially in such a relaxing place? Given the time to think, I peeled back the onion. 

I harbored many expectations and hopes about who I would become upon beginning this adventure abroad. My hope was that a new place would help me relax and reflect, and ultimately "make me happier", as lame as that sounds. 

The strange thing is, it did. For a while. But now, I don't know where to go next!

I'm slowly starting to understand that a rewarding life comes from continuously achieving goals and appreciating every moment you find yourself in - not designing some utopian end state and reaching it, as comforting as that end state is to imagine. I've understood this _in theory_ from books and guru posts on Medium, but it's something different to intuitively feel it to be true in my own situation. And to remember it, constantly. 

Izu Peninsula
======
The next morning started pleasantly with a quick "ohayo gozaimas" to _every single person_ in the hotel breakfast room at 7:30am. We hit the road promptly at 8 and started the long journey down along the edge of Tokyo to the coast of the Izu Peninsula. The entire peninsula was formed by volcanous erupting between 3 tectonic plates, leading to a beautifully undulating and rocky coastline punctuated by seaside fishing towns and onsen resorts.

The entire peninsula is swarmed with motorcyclists as well, riding in packs along the winding roads. Curiously, despite many riding large racing bikes, I didn't see a single person riding more than a reasonable speed beyond the (ridiculously slow) 40kph speed limit. 

In one and a half days, we managed to ride around almost the entire peninsula, stopping for the night in Ito to stay in a beautiful traditional Japanese building.

We visited the Amagiso onsen in the middle of the peninsula, an outdoor onsen (*rotenburo*) right next to a river fed by an epic waterfall.

We also stopped at the Sawada onsen (really a *rotenburo*) up on the coastal cliffs above Nishiizu, on the west side of the peninsula.

Japan, on this trip, felt like a parallel universe - one where people live comfortable lives in a safe country with first world infrastructure, but a totally different language, cultural norms,foods, and attitudes. Peering through the looking glass was a fun and fascinating experience. 

For instance, all the onsen are nude - so you end up hanging out with a bunch of old Japanese men in mineral baths totally nude. Which is bound to lead to a story or two. Here's one:

The Sawada onsen was set up on a hill, so my friend and I climbed the 3 sets of stairs up there and found all there was to the place was a small bath through a tiny passageway no bigger than 6 feet by 6 feet with a few lockers and a sink in it. 

After a few minutes in the bath, my friend peered over the wooden fence that surrounded the baths and noticed an old Japanese man jogging up the stairs to the bath, quickly speaking to us as soon as he saw my friend's head pop over the fence. The man (very politely) came in to the onsen and presumably explained to us (entirely in Japanese) that we needed to pay to use the onsen. We had totally missed the ticket booth at the entrance and went straight to the bath. 

As I forgot my towel, I had to search through my bag for 1200 yen to pay this very nice man, all the while standing in front of him totally nude and dripping wet. We had a laugh out of that one. 

Even better, the man came back 5 minutes later to mime to us that the lights on my scooter were still on, and he didn't want my battery to die. What a homie. 

You Gotta Love It
======
My last stop of my friend's ride through half of Japan was in the city of Shizuoka. After sleeping through our chance to visit an izakaya (Japanese pub) on Saturday night in Ito, we were determined to find something poppin' in Shizuoka. 

We stopped in a craft beer bar and found that wasn't quite the vibe we were looking for, so we journeyed onwards. Despite the streets being filled with people walking, all the izakayas were either closed or empty. While walking down a bright and rather strange street littered with karaoke bars and sex shops, we noticed a group of about 20 people sitting in front of an izakaya had stopped their conversations to stare at us. They appeared to be young and fun, so I grabbed my friend - we had to go in here. The kids were rather shocked when we turned around and walked straight in to their group, beckoning them in to the izakaya. 

My friend boldly sat at a large table and welcomed everyone to sit down. After a nice 2 minutes of awkwardly trying to figure out if we were all sitting together, and how, we got settled, ordered drinks, and got down to learning names. Thankfully, many in the group spoke pretty good English - turned out they were university students in Shizuoka, a few of whom had studied in Canada. 

We proceeded to hammer back beers, try matcha cocktails, play rock paper scissors as a drinking game, pick the "coolest" in the group (their idea), and learn that you can switch WiFis and bluetooth connections from the iPhone "control center". 

After an hour of drinking, we taught them a catch phrase we'd been using liberally over the past few days: *You gotta love it*

This came in handy constantly on the trip - just a few examples:
- When we stopped for gas in a random seaside town, a truck driver behind us was casually sitting in his cab with his pet *owl*

- In the hotel we stayed at on the outskirts of Tokyo, the elevator had a little pad above the "up" button to be touched before touching the button, in order to prevent static electricity shock.

- We stopped at a roadside tangerine stand to find the owners of it were just about to leave - they left about 20 bags of tangerines on a table with a sign saying "100 yen each" and a honor-system collection bin for the money.

- After having dinner in a random restaurant by the side of the road on the way to Shizuoka, we came across a community dance competition.

Processing
======
After almost two months in Chiang Mai, this trip was a chance to process all the change. Riding through the countryside, especially, gave me many hours to ponder. 

I'm not sure I want to put in to words how I feel. However, I know the experiences of this trip will have a lasting impact on me like a handful of other trips have in the past. 

I am incredibly lucky to call the guy I rode through Japan with a friend (you know who you are). He reminded us so many times on this trip that we are so lucky to be here, right now, experiencing this. I appreciate that reminder.
