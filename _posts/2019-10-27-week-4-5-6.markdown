It has been far too long since I posted - apologies. The last few weeks were pretty action-packed, so hopefully this post makes up for the delay. 

As I sit in one of my favorite coffee shops in the city to write this, the last few weeks feel like months. I feel settled in this place, beyond knowing where to get a good late night meal and do my laundry - I've found a level of comfort operating here, a core group of friends, a rhythm to life. Also, a passion for motorcycles ;) 

What the Hell Happened
======
The last three weeks have been fairly bonkers. Since my last post on Tuesday the 8th, I tried the best Khao Soi I've ever had, went to a Burning-Man-esque rave at the Grand Canyon, flew to Austin for 4 days for an incredibly energizing work retreat, found a new apartment, rented a GPX Legend cafe racer, went to the first Bitcoin-only meetup in Chiang Mai visited "The Roof of Thailand", climbed in a waterfall, introduced a Thai local to real tequila (she's a fan), and very quickly built some strong friendships. Let's dive in.

The real Grand Canyon
======
Someone in my group of friends caught wind of an event called Dreamscape at "the Grand Canyon", an old flooded quarry about a half-hour southwest of Chiang Mai. About 10 of us packed in to taxi's and our friend's SUV and headed to the canyon on a Saturday afternoon to vibe out in the water. 

The canyon has sheer cliffs on all sides and a few spots you can jump. One girl in our group, bless her heart, went really gung ho and wanted to jump off the highest point as soon as we arrived. Unfortunately, she landed a bit awkwardly, and due to prior back problems literally broke her back - 3 month recovery time. We are praying for you! And if you're reading this, I owe you some tequila and barbeque rub from the States. 

We helped her get to the hospital where some friends were waiting for her, then returned to the party. As night fell, the Canyon closed their waters and the party shifted to the ramp that used to take trucks down in to the bottom of the quarry. There was a stage set up with DJs doing their thing and a bar behind serving copious Chang and Sangsom rum. The crowd was half Thai half hippie foreigners, people in bathing suits swaying to chill electronic beats. 

A few hours in to the party, I caught up with someone from my coworking space - we see each other almost every weekday, but he made a good point that we'd never seen each other outside of "work" mode. The Canyon was a great place to see a different side of each other. 

After a quick 3 hour sleep, I was up for my flight to Austin. 26 hours of travel ensued!

Takeoff
======
Excited to meet my coworkers in Austin for a few days of brainstorming and barbeque, I showed up to the airport feeling chipper. All praise to my company and our admin team, I was on business class on EVA Air almost the entire trip to Austin, so I was looking forward to the flights more than dreading the time change and confined space. 

However, taking off on my first leg from Chiang Mai to Taipei, I felt sad. I really like it here so far. It didn't help that the first thing I saw off the plane in Seattle (my 2nd layover) was a triple-chinned man in a Seahawks jersey (sorry, Kyle). I miss Thailand!

The Austin trip was overwhelmingly fun. Our whole team of 80 people, from analysts to marketers to strategy gurus all got fired up thinking bigger and better about what we want to do together in 2020. We spent 8 hours a day in conference rooms discussing successes, bonding over blockers, and planning for domination. Then we took our ragged selves to Rainey street or 6th street and got to know each other on a different level. Since the company is fully remote, this was the first time many of us met, despite being on calls sometimes every single day together. Meeting someone in person for the first time after feeling like you already know them so well is a strange, and awesome, feeling. 

Our last day we had a truly Texan experience - the gun range. It was a ton of fun watching people who had never fired a gun before give it a try, safely! When our time was almost up and only the nuttiest of us were left shooting, the experience became even more Texan when the instructor/supervisor yelled out over the din of rounds firing, "HOW DO WE FEEL ABOUT GUN RIGHTS?!"

The gun rights 'conversation' in America has all but ceased - it doesn't seem to be a conversation anymore. There is no debate, you are either on one side or the other. It was interesting for me to leave New York City and come to this gun range, because it gave a glimpse in to another side of how people think. We as a society no doubt have much work to do to keep weapons as lethal as handguns and assault rifles out of the the hands of mentally ill people and those with destructive desires. However, the right to bear arms can be a check on state power - a last resort, albeit horrific, to resist oppression. This is the very situation the founding fathers were in - resisting a well-armed and well-organized state that sought to take more from people than they felt was fair. Without arms, that struggle may have ended much differently. 

Coming Home
======
On the flights back from Austin, I frequently thought about home.

What is home? 

Looking down on the outskirts of Taipei, it feels foreign. The houses don't feel familiar to me, the cars, the streets. Landing in Chiang Mai doesn't feel like home either - it is more of an exciting frontier. 

But did I ever feel like I was coming home when I was landing in Chicago? In New York? 

No. I never felt much of anything about Chicago, and New York just felt like eating a bag of coffee beans. Energy straight to the veins. 

All of this is to say I don't think I've found my home yet. Which has me thinking that maybe I am here and traveling because I am searching for it. Maybe that desire is why I don't feel a pull to travel around perpetually, to be a "nomad". Why I instead feel a pull to learn a place, a language, a culture for a few years at least. To see if I can find a home. 

I don't say this to drum up sympathy. I don't want your sympathy. This is just a problem in life that I have to tackle - we all have them - and many (myself included) probably prefer this problem to most others. 

Ride Fast, Die Slow
======
Since my Week 3 trip to Pai on a proper motorcycle, I couldn't get the bike out of my head. The speed, the balance in the corners, it was addicting!

When I returned from Austin, one of the first things I did was text my scooter rental place about availability for a GPX Legend - a decent 200 cc cafe racer bike, manual with a bit more power than a scooter but far from wheelie-ing if you keep it twisted. 

The rental place I go to has a single GPX - a gorgeous deep red beast with a throaty sound and nicely aged (read: rusted) handlebars. 

![gpx-legend](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/initialcondition/initialcondition.github.io/master/_site/assets/images/ombra.jpg)

Thankfully the shop let me end my scooter rental a few days early and start with the GPX the day I returned from Austin. 

I gave it some thought after the trip to Pai and figured going 80mph on a country road in Thailand in Uniqlo jeans and a denim jacket from Tesco wasn't the brightest idea for my skin and life expectancy. So I set a budget and rode over to Helmet2Home, a hole-in-the-wall moto gear shop with a great selection of high quality (mostly Japanese) riding armor. I dropped a nice $450 on a jacket, pants, and boots for long road trips where I just need to *keep it twisted*. 

The pricetag gave a bit of sticker shock, but I tried to reframe it to myself in terms of loss. If I skid out without gear, even at 30mph, I'm losing a few layers of skin at the very least, most likely with a few broken bones. My hospital bill alone would probably clear $450, not to mention the agony and recovery time associated with a crash. Skid out on a highway at 80mph and I'm going straight up to heaven. So $450 is a small price to pay - too *little*, maybe - I might be going back for a neck protector and better gloves than the $10 ones I have now from Tesco (a grocery store). 

วิดีโอ - Sai Oua
======
I'm starting to get good at navigating the local market in Santitham. I know the words for sticky rice (ค่าว-เหฺนียว "khaao niaao"), papaya salad (ส้มตำ "som tam"), and the phenomenally flavorful northern Thai sausage "sai oua". 

Everything else I order with the point and shoot method, sometimes guessing whether it's pork (moo) or chicken (guy). That technique is working out pretty well so far - I've discovered some amazing dishes that way, like a spicy red pork mix with plenty of juicy fat. On a usual post-Muay-Thai trip, I'll pick up 2-3 things and a bag of sticky rice - total cost? Around $4. 

Finding an Apartment
======
For my first month in Chiang Mai, I stayed at Santitham Guesthouse - while it's quite a nice spot, I wanted a place with less mosquitos (they were EVERYWHERE) and some semblance of a view / elevation. In my search, I discovered that condos and apartments here rarely rent for less than 6 months, and don't come with internet. Plus, they are on the expensive side - starting around $400/month for 30sq meters, and that's on a 1 year lease. 

Like many of the cool spots discovered in Chiang Mai, housing is best found by just walking around. On the walk from my favorite breakfast spot to a coffee shop, I passed by a 4 story building of serviced apartments. These long-stay hotel rooms lack kitchens but are cleaned every week and carry much lower month-to-month pricetags - this one is costing me $250/month. I'm on the third floor with a nice balcony and almost no street noise - only bird noise. I think I'll stay here a while. 

Graph Cafe and other assorted places to take pictures of my bike
======
Coffee culture is taking off in Chiang Mai. On the menu at a trendy shop in Nimman called Ristr8tto, I found a list of other coffee shops in the city. Last week, I took my GPX over to one of the places on that list, Graph Cafe, on the east side of the old city. I planned to take care of a few things (including this blog post) in the early afternoon. Unfortunately, nothing got done, considering the place is about the size of a walk in closet - but damn, the drinks were good. 

Graph seems to specialize in cold brew and nitro - their menu is packed full of delicious and inventive drinks like the No. 18 and Midtown. 

![no-18](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/initialcondition/initialcondition.github.io/master/_site/assets/images/no18.jpg)

![gpx-at-graph](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/initialcondition/initialcondition.github.io/master/_site/assets/images/graph.jpg)

The drinks will run you a nice $5, but they're worth it to assuage a hankering for cold brew. 

The other place for decent cold brew is Ama Akha in Santitham, which sells "black juice" a filthy strong concoction that absolutely jacks me up and only costs 80 baht ($2.66) for a 12 ounce bottle. 

Making, and Choosing, Friends
======
The last three weeks were most impactful for the friendships made, and chosen. 

It's easy to meet people in this city and make plans - people are generally pretty free and open, especially travelers with established businesses or those just picking up a skill and chilling out. 

Sometimes you strike out: I had a great coffee with one guy, we'll call him Charles - but I was put off by his attitude when we went for dinner. I had my CBR250 that night, and after a fairly harrowing ride through dense traffic to make it to the dinner spot, he absolutely refused to sit and eat at the restaurant. He wanted to take the foot away and back to his place, on the back of my bike, in traffic again. He said he didn't like the tourists at the restaurant - I was wondering, what are you afraid of? Why can't we just sit and eat? 

Other interactions have been much better. Mary, the Aussie I met my first night, and I are becoming closer during our "shift change" at the co-working space - when she leaves around 8pm as I arrive. I feel I can trust her, and since I'm just getting to know her, I can share anything - we are blank slates to each other. There are no expectations of who we are as people. 

I also met another Evan, who is super chill and easy to hang out with - we grab dinner from time to time and explore spots outside the city occasionally. Our little group of friends has started to refer to us as Evan Boy and Evan Girl. Makes keeping track of us a bit easier. 

Then there's May, born and raised in Chiang Mai and owner of a nice shop that makes a killer mango sticky rice. I am proud to have introduced her to real tequila, and thankful for her kindness in driving us around town to the Grand Canyon and even Doi Inthanon in her SUV. 

And there's a couple from the UK, we'll call them Savannah and Connor. They're always cracking jokes, hardworking, and adventurous. Connor is a big fan of motorbikes too, and we bonded riding together on the tiny seat of my GPX. Despite only knowing these two for a week, I feel like I've known them for ages. 

Life round here is not too bad. I'll leave you with a picture of Mae Ya waterfall (great fun to climb in) and the Roof of Thailand, Doi Inthanon. See you at the next post :)
