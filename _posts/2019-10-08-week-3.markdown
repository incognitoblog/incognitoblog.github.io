Three weeks down, and many more to come. Living in Chiang Mai is a nice blend of exciting and relaxing. There's a buzz here from the locals and expats that is not unlike what I felt in New York - everyone is going somewhere, working on something, hustling to achieve whatever their goal might be. In US cities it seemed like the goal was often career advancement or status attainment - here, the goals seem to center around travel and cultural experiences. 

The Thai people I've met want to see more of Asia, or go to Europe or the US. The expats are working to achieve a lifestyle of some kind - they're either building a business so they can hopefully have that lifestyle full time, are already owners of functioning businesses and actually living the 4 hour work week life, or are working a low-hour and flexible job (like teaching English online) that allows them to travel on a lite budget in perpetuity. 

You will always miss _something_.
======
Two weeks before I left for Chiang Mai, I spent a week with my cousin who just finished a total of 8 years living in Tokyo. One of the many wise pieces of advice she shared with me was that you will always miss _something_ from the US - usually a boring everyday thing you take for granted, that you suddenly can't find in your new country. 

For one of her friends, it was cake mix - apparently not a common item in Japan. This friend used to fly in a suitcase of cake mix and frosting from Guam to stock up for birthday parties and special events. 

At first, I scoffed - I can't think of a single toiletry or food item that I regularly use or feel any sort of attachment to. Well when my deodorant stick started to show that little grid at the bottom, meaning it's all spent up, I learned. 

It turns out they don't sell stick deodorant in Thailand, at least not in the 4 stores I checked. The only option is an anti-perspirant liquid with a rolly ball. In my experience, anti-perspirant ironically makes me sweat like a pig, but at some point I had to bike the bullet and just buy it. Pray for me. 

Keeping in touch
======
One concern I had when I decided to make the move to Thailand is how my friendships would stand the test of distance and time(zone). Would I fall out of touch? 

So far, I feel the opposite has been true. While it's certainly harder to see people in person, I am thankful for all the calls and well wishes I'm getting from family and friends. Since my morning overlaps pretty well with West Coast evening, I'm able to get a call or two in if I like. For East Coast friends, my evening and their morning works pretty well. 

Thank you to those of you who gave me a call!

Drink Up, Pussy!
======
I'm starting to think they put something in the alcohol here, because my hangovers are _wicked_. Either that, or I'm just drinking the cheap stuff. On Friday night, I went out with a few friends I met last weekend, and they set up a "hangout" on the Couchsurfing app so anyone on the app in Chiang Mai could find us. While there are many of these hangouts listed on Couchsurfing in CM, none have more than 2-3 people attending them, and almost every one I've seen has "Josh" attending - we've taken to calling him Josh the Couchsurfing Bot. 

So when we put up the hangout, we didn't expect much to come of it. Boy were we wrong. Enter Mai, a Thai girl with a love for learning English insults. While our group of 4 was all downing double Changs, someone called me a pussy for having the most beer left in my bottle. In my defense, I was already 2 double Changs deep plus a bottle of wine, so I was running out of room in there. Mai quickly picked up "pussy", and proceeded to address me as pussy for the rest of the night - until she looked it up in Google Translate, at which point her jaw dropped and she apologized profusely. We all had a good laugh. 

She also told us many a tourist has walked past her on the street and asked "How much?" - we told her to look them up and down and respond "ah, I am far too expensive for you." So I look forward to hearing about the next tourist she owns. 

"You should probably learn to ride this on your own"
======
One of things I love most about Chiang Mai is the immediately accessible mountains and nature. This weekend, I made plans to head to Pai with a lady friend on motorcycles - she would ride her 300cc BMW touring bike, and I would rent something more powerful than my 125cc scooter so I could have a fighting chance of keeping up with her pace. I upgraded my ride for the weekend to a proper motorcycle: a 250cc [Honda CBR][cbr]. We left for Pai on sunday, but I put together a trip with a handful of friends on Saturday up to a botanical garden 1 hour north of Chiang Mai, so I rented the bike on Saturday morning to get some practice on it before the 2.5 hour ride to Pai. 

Being my first time riding a manual motorcycle on the street, I stalled it a bunch right off the lot and gave a little love tap (no damage) to a car on my way to pick up a friend. I had planned on taking her on my back up to the gardens, but upon seeing me roll up straight stalling out, her first words were "you should probably learn to ride this on your own..." That was probably the right move, in retrospect. She grabbed a scooter for herself, and after breakfast our crew of five set off for the garden.

Without any issues, we made it up through the beautiful mountain passes to the Queen Sirikit Botanical Garden. We all got to know each other as we meandered through greenhouses of water lilies and an epic canopy walk. We stopped for a drink at a cafe with a view down the mountain, and chatted about the ride up - it was then that I learned from my friend who used to race motorcycles that was I actually trying to start the bike in 2nd gear, not 1st, for the entire day. That made the ride further up the mountain to Moncham (ม่อนแจ่ม) signficantly easier. On the way back down, I started to feel very stable on the bike, even letting my hands off the handlebars and steering with just my body weight. 

No wipeouts on the ride and a great time getting to know each other.

The Road to Pai
======
After our ride to the botanical garden, I realized I needed some better gear. With my hands slipping off the handlebars, I took the recommendation of a local girl from Chiang Mai to go to Decathlon for gloves and gear. 

Unfortunately upon arriving, I noticed Decathlon had _cycling_ gear, not _motorcycling_ gear. Thankfully the nearbyTesco (like a Walmart) had the right equipment. I picked up a pair of gloves, the most expensive helmet I could find (figured my head is worth it, right?) and the thickest jacket they had in stock - a light denim jacket. I was ready for Pai. 

The next morning I woke up with a decent hangover from my "I'll just have one beer" night turning in to a 5 beers night, but after some water I was ready to hop on the bike. My friend and I had agreed to meet at a coffeshop about a half hour north of Chiang Mai, but due to some Google Maps issues I overshot it by 20 minutes, almost causing her to go home and abandon the whole trip! Luckily an appliance store owner was nice enough to give me his wifi password so I could get some reliable internet and find a new meeting point. From then on, the ride was spectacular. Started with gentle curves through valleys then tight, high-grade switchbacks up and down through the mountains. 

I came close to wiping out only once: I tried to downshift on a turn, but downshifting is like braking (especially when you just drop the engine at low RPMs in to the lower gear, as I did). When you brake in a turn, the bike wants to stand up straight from whatever angle it's leaning at. The result, if you're leaning far enough and going fast enough, is called "highsiding" - the bike effectively flips from leaning to the inside of the curve to the outside, throwing the rider over the "high side". Thankfully I wasn't going nearly fast enough to throw myself - just got a quick jerk out of the handlebars. Learned my lesson nonetheless. 

Pai was a beautiful place. We stayed in a [hut seated on a quiet rice paddy][pkn] and explored the town and [lookout points][yun-lai] around it. The crisp mountain air and singing birds were a welcome reprieve from the heat and scooter noise of downtown Chiang Mai. When night fell, we looked for a good party, but being a Sunday night we settled for drinking rum and listening to a jazz band jam out.

Living here is not too bad. 

Until the next post, peace!
